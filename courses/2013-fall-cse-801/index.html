This course will run from 9/25/12 - 12/4/12 (on a mixed UW/MSU schedule)
and will be offered by videoconference at remote BEACON locations, as
part of the BEACON Center collaborations.
Please, no sitting in without doing the work.

<p>


Prerequisites: graduate standing in the natural sciences and/or
engineering, OR permission of instructor.  (An override is required to
enroll for this course at MSU; please send the your full name and PID
to <a href='mailto:ctb@msu.edu'>the instructor</a>.)

<h3>Course information:</h3>

<p>

Performing research in biology increasingly requires computational skills
and quantitative reasoning abilities.  This course will introduce students
to computational thinking and practice through an intensive scripting
and programming regimen, built around a series of models and data sets
from evolutionary and molecular biology.  During this course we will
introduce the Python programming language, scripting and pipelining,
evolutionary modeling, and data analysis.
<p>
This course is intended for graduate students with little or no
previous programming experience.  There are no prerequisites other
than a strong background in at least one of evolution, ecology,
genetics, or molecular biology.  Enrollment by permission of
instructor only.
<p>

In addition to teleconferenced lectures and discussion, we will be
providing classroom lectures via YouTube and e-mail discussion.

<P>
The learning objectives for this course include the following:
<ul>
<li> Students will be able to analyze spreadsheet-style data, using the
     Python programming language in the IPython Notebook
<li> Students will implement agent-based models for evolutionary modeling;
<li> Students will be able to perform basic short-read sequencing data analysis,
     including mapping, assembly, and visualization;
<li> Students will know how to organize input data, programs, and results
     for computational reproducibility and data publication;
</ul>

<h3>Pre-course workshops</h3>

A mandatory pre-course "zero-entry" workshop will help everyone work
through installation and setup issues, as well as cover basic
introductory concepts.

<p>

At MSU this workshop will take place on Sep 23rd and 25th,
from 1-5pm.

<p>

At UW, this workshop will take place on the weekend of Sep 28th and 29th,
from noon to 5pm.

<a href='syllabus.html'><h3>Course Syllabus</h3></a>

<i>Objectives:</i> At the end of the course, you will have gained
basic programming skills in Python, been exposed to a variety of
biology & evolution research that uses computation, and learned how to
use iPads to facilitate distance collaboration.
<p>
<i>Course structure:</i> Class will consist of group exercises,
lectures on various topics, and student presentations.  Most weeks,
there will be programming homework as well as a paper or two to read,
digest, and answer questions on.
<p>
<i>Homework and grading:</i> Individual homeworks will be graded on a
P/F basis.  Homeworks will contribute evenly to 80% of the final
grade, i.e. ~20 homeworks each worth 4%.  In class presentation (also
P/F) will contribute the final 20%.  Attendance will count for the
same as homework, although absences can be arranged in advance.  Group
or collaborative work is allowed and encouraged on homework, although
students must each hand in homework and are individually responsible
for their solutions.
<p>
<i>Materials:</i> Most of the course will use materials developed by
the instructor, which will be placed on the Web.  All such course
materials will be made available under a Creative Commons license
(CC-BY-SA 2.0), use/reuse OK but attribution required.  There is no
required textbook, but students may find "Practical Computing for
Biologists" (Haddock/Dunn) useful reference material.
<p>
<i>Attendance:</i> Attendance is generally required, especially since there will be in-class group projects.
<p>
<i>Office hours:</i>

There are no set office hours for Dr. Brown.  If you make an
appointment with him, he is located on MSU campus in BPS 2228(c).  His
Skype ID is c.titus.brown, and his FaceTime ID is 'titus@idyll.org'.
<p>
Art Covert is available 1-4pm Central time, at UT Austin.  His Skype ID
is covertspartan.
